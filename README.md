### introduction: 
Munch Minder is a versatile photo blog and personal space for detailing your most recent culinary escapades, bragging to your friends about homemade creations, or simply logging what you ate or drank in an intuitive and easy to use way.

In the future you'll be able to create groups for friends or family, but for now simply add friends to share and show what you've been enjoying!
